 CARDINAL

**Coordinated Acoustic Recording and Distributed Inference for Naturalistic Animal Localization**

CARDINAL is an open-source framework for three-dimensional localization of vocalizing animals using small distributed arrays of passive acoustic recorders. It was developed for deployment in complex real-world soundscapes — forest edges, wetlands, and heterogeneous field environments — using affordable GPS-synchronized autonomous recording units.

The system integrates automated multi-recorder event matching, frequency-selective cross-correlation for time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) estimation, geometric cycle-consistency filtering, and nonlinear optimization of source location and effective sound speed. Applied to multi-year datasets from field sites in southwestern Arkansas, CARDINAL recovers ecologically meaningful spatial structure in bird vocalizations without manual curation.

## Status

CARDINAL is described in the following preprint:

> Cissel, R.S., Brown, P.O., and Eisen, M.B. (2026). Automated three-dimensional localization of calling birds with small passive acoustic arrays in complex soundscapes. *bioRxiv*.

Code and data are actively being prepared for release. We will post:

- The full CARDINAL pipeline, from BirdNET detections through to localized coordinates
- Hardware documentation and field deployment protocols
- Example datasets sufficient to run the pipeline end-to-end
- Analysis code and data underlying all figures in the paper

Check back soon, or watch this organization to be notified when repositories go public.
